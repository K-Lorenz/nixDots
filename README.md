## INSPIRED BY https://github.com/XNM1/linux-nixos-hyprland-config-dotfiles


This repository houses my NixOS Linux ‚ùÑÔ∏è flake configuration, featuring the Hyprland window manager and adorned with the stylish Catppuccin Macchiato theme. I rely on this setup as my daily driver for work and programming. Feel free to utilize it in its entirety or borrow specific components for your own configuration.

üö® It's essential to note that this configuration is not minimalistic or lightweight and may require some disk space and knowledge to understand. If you're looking for something simpler, this configuration may not be suitable for you.

This system leverages cutting-edge channels and versions of software to provide you with the latest updates and features. Notably, it utilizes:

- **flake** (An experimental feature of the Nix package manager)
- **nixpkgs**: unstable
- 
This approach ensures that you stay on the forefront of technology, receiving the most recent software advancements promptly. üö® However, it's important to note that this emphasis on bleeding-edge software may impact the stability of the system.

The system also enables SELinux patches, as well as AppArmor and Tomoyo Linux Security Modules. It includes security daemons such as Fail2Ban and USBGuard, with Firejail preinstalled to meet your security requirements.

You have the flexibility to customize these configurations according to your needs by modifying the respective configuration files.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Download and Install NixOS from the [official site](https://nixos.org/download).
2. Temporarily install ripgrep and fish using the command: `nix-shell -p ripgrep fish --run fish`. You can also use classic bash and grep for the next step without installing fish and ripgrep.
3. Run the command `rg --hidden FIXME` and change/add lines to match your device, swaps, partitions, peripherals, file systems, etc. in the configuration files. 
4. To change the default username and/or hostname, run the command `rg --hidden 'konrad'` to find and fix all instances of the username, and `rg --hidden 'konrad-nixos'` for the hostname. üö® Make sure to change the username to match yours set during installation to avoid login issues. üö® Also, don't forget to delete or change to yours the git settings in `home/.gitconfig`, `home/projects/.gitconfig.personal`, and `home/work/.gitconfig.work` files, as they are configured for my personal use.
5. Enable `flake` support (more [here](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Enable_flakes_temporarily)) on your current system. Don't forget to run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` after enabling `flake` in your `/etc/configuration.nix`.
6. Copy or move all files (with replacements) from the `home` directory to your `$HOME` directory in Linux.
7. Copy or move all files (with replacements and **sudo** permissions) from the `nixos` directory to `/etc/nixos/`. üö® Ensure that `system.stateVersion = "your_version";` is correctly set to the release version of the initial installation of your system in the `configuration.nix` file. üö® Also, for security reasons, ensure all files in the `/etc/nixos` directory are owned by **root**. If not, change ownership using the command: `sudo chown -R root:root /etc/nixos`.
8. Run the command `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake /etc/nixos#your-hostname` or `nswitchu`. If you chose first command, replace `your-hostname` with your hostname before running the command; by default, hostname is set to `isitreal-laptop`.

Common commands:
- `cl`: clear the terminal screen (shorthand for `clear`)
- `lgit`: launch the `lazygit` command-line Git client
- `ldocker`: launch the `lazydocker` command-line Docker client
- `conf`: navigate to the `~/.config` directory

NixOS-specific commands:
- `nswitch`: rebuild your system using the current flake
- `nswitchu`: rebuild and update your system using the current flake
- `nau`: add the unstable channel to the package manager
- `nsgc`: optimize the nix store and remove unreferenced and obsolete store paths (equivalent to `sudo nix-store --gc`)
- `ngc`: delete old generations of user profiles (equivalent to `sudo nix-collect-garbage -d`)
- `nixos`: navigate to the `/etc/nixos` directory
- `store`: navigate to the `/nix/store` directory

You can customize this configuration by adding more aliases to the file and editing existing ones. This makes your experience more personalized and smoother.
